= pbscc-proxy version 2 =

New version of the pbscc-proxy is available.

The main change in this version is how PBSCC controls object locking.

Now pbscc uses native *svn lock* ability for object locking.

However you can create file _scc.ini_ in the root of your work-copy.

*svn.ini sample*
{{{
[config]
; lock strategy: 
;   "lock"  using svn lock (default from version 2.x)
;   "prop"  using svn properties (old behavior)
lock.strategy=prop
}}}
