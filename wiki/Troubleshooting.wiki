== PB is connected to SVN, but not working ==

Enable pbscc debug logging:

Please spesify a full path of the log file in the registry

http://dm.char.com.ua/pb/pbscc/img/image014.png

All svn.exe commands will be logged into this file.

So you can repeat them from the command shell and see where the problem appears.

If the problem still remains, use google group to ask your questions:
http://groups.google.com/group/pbscc

Please attach the log to your question.
